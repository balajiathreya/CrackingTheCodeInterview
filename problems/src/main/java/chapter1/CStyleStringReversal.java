 * Created by baathreya on 3/24/15.
 *
 * Write code to reverse a C-Style String (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character )
 *
 * Question:
 * what does the question mean? Do strings in Java end with a '\0'. I didn't think so? If so, how do you do
 * string reversal - do a normal string reversal, but without using objects
 *
 * ignore this question for now.
