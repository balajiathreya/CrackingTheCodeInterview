 * Given a binary search tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth
 * (i.e., if you have a tree with depth D, youâ€™ll have D linked lists).
 *
 *
 * extend misc.BreadthFirstSearch.java and modify search() such that it prints all nodes. process() doesn't
 * have to do anything
